        "When evaluating a classification machine learning model, it's essential to use appropriate metrics that reflect its performance accurately. Metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall (sensitivity), and F1-score are suitable for assessing classification models. Accuracy measures the proportion of correctly classified instances out of the total instances, providing an overall view of the model's correctness. Precision quantifies the accuracy of positive predictions, while recall (sensitivity) measures the proportion of actual positives that are correctly identified by the model. The F1-score, which is the harmonic mean of precision and recall, balances these two metrics and is particularly useful in scenarios where there is an uneven class distribution.\n"
